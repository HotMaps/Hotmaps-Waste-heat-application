# Toolbox
# The toolbox will facilitate the following tasks on a spatially disaggregated level: 
#	  (1) Mapping heating and cooling energy situation including renewable and waste heat potentials in GIS layers,
# 	(2) Model the energy system, considering hourly matching of supply and demand, demand response etc.,
#	  (3) Supporting the comprehensive assessment of efficient heating and cooling according to the Energy Efficiency Directive,
#	  (4) Comparative assessment of supply and demand options and of given scenarios until 2050 regarding e. g. CO2-emissions, costs, share of renewables.
